# Head-Clicker
Grade 12 C++ Final Project

Combines a simple "aim trainer" where you try to click as accurately as possible on randomly appearing circles with a wave based zombie style game 

The most interesting parts of this project were using the cursor controls, adding sound, importing images and most importantly divising my own method of calculating the distances between the "zombies" and the center using the screen pixels
